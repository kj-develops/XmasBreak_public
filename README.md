# xmasBreak
A break-out game in a christmas edition. My very first game ever made! The ball bounces of the walls and paddle (in a way that you can steer by hitting the left or right side of the paddle). It breaks bricks by hitting them. When the ball falls down outside the paddle you loose, and when all bricks are removed you win.

You can not run this program because parts of the code has been removed due to privacy reasons.

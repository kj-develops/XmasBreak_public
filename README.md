# xmasBreak
My very first breakout game. Christmas-style that is.

You can run this program by installing Python3 and running the xmasbreak.py file in your terminal by typing `python3 xmasbreak.py`. Make sure to have all the other files in the zip folder in the same directory when you run the program the game will not work without the other files. 

Enjoy!
